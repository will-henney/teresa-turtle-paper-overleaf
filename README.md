NGC 6210 paper. Synced with the version owned by Tere on Overleaf

Assuming changes have been made both to overleaf version and to version on my laptop:

1. Push changes from overleaf to github
2. Fetch changes from github to my laptop
3. Rebase any local commits and resolve any conflicts
4. Push from my laptop to github
5. Pull changes back from github to overleaf

Best not to push any commits from my laptop to github 
until I have checked that the overleaf version hasn't changed in the meantime.

Symmetry and asymmetry in the Turtle Nebula

### Abstract

We carry out a comprehensive kinematic and morphological study of the
asymmetrical planetary nebula: NGC 6210, known as the Turtle.  The
nebula's spectacularly chaotic appearance has led to proposals that it
was shaped by mass transfer in a triple star system.  We study the
three-dimensional structure and kinematics of its shells, lobes,
knots, and haloes by combining radial velocity mapping from multiple
long-slit spectra with proper motion measurements from multi-epoch
imaging.  We find that the nebula has five distinct ejection axes.
The first is the axis of the bipolar, wind-blown inner shell, while
the second is the axis of the lop-sided, elliptical, fainter, but more
massive intermediate shell.  A further two axes are bipolar flows that
form the point symmetric, high-ionization outer lobes, all with
inclinations close to the plane of the sky.  The final axis, which is
inclined close to the line of sight, traces collimated outflows of
low-ionization knots.  We detect major changes in outflow directions
over the last 6000 years, beginning in the pre-planetary nebula phase
and continuing through the ionization of the nebula, which began
3500 years ago.  Most notably, all redshifted low-ionization knots
have kinematic ages greater than 2000 years, whereas all blueshifted
knots have ages younger than 2000 years.  Such a sudden and permanent
180-degree flip in the ejection axis at a relatively late stage in the
nebular evolution is a challenge to models of planetary nebula
formation and shaping.
