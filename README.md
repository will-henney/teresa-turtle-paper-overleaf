NGC 6210 paper. Synced with the version owned by Tere on Overleaf

Assuming changes have been made both to overleaf version and to version on my laptop:

1. Push changes from overleaf to github
2. Fetch changes from github to my laptop
3. Rebase any local commits and resolve any conflicts
4. Push from my laptop to github
5. Pull changes back from github to overleaf

Best not to push any commits from my laptop to github 
until I have checked that the overleaf version hasn't changed in the meantime.
