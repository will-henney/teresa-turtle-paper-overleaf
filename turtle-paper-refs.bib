  Abstract =	 {We present three methods for deriving the velocity
                  field in magnetized regions of the Sun's
                  photosphere. As a preliminary step, we introduce a
                  Fourier-based local correlation tracking (LCT)
                  routine that we term ``FLCT.'' By explicitly
                  employing the observation made by DÃ©moulin &amp;
                  Berger, that results determined by LCT applied to
                  magnetograms involve a combination of all components
                  of the velocity and magnetic fields, we show that a
                  three-component velocity field can be derived, in a
                  method we term algebraic decomposition, or
                  ADC. Finally, we introduce ILCT, a method that
                  enforces consistency between the normal component of
                  the induction equation and results obtained from
                  LCT. When used with photospheric vector
                  magnetograms, ILCT determines a three-component
                  photospheric velocity field suitable for use with
                  time sequences of such magnetograms to drive
                  boundary conditions for MHD simulations of the solar
                  corona. We present results from these methods
                  applied to vector magnetograms of NOAA AR 8210 on
                  1998 May 1.},
