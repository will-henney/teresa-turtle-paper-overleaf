** Dealing with the referee's points

1. [ ] Representative spectra or colorscale PV image 
2. [ ] Slit labelling - collision with axis labelling 
   - (lower case letters for slits?)
3. [ ] Better indicate axis direction on figures
4. [ ] Proper motion nitpicks
5. [ ] More details on how velocities are derived
6. [ ] Something about axes of inner shell
7. [ ] Velocity gradients versus amplitudes
   - Michael was right!
8. [ ] Last sentence of section 4.2
9. [ ] More discussion on knot complex
10. [ ] Can we rule out a brief ejection event?
11. [ ] Older lobes that have faded?


* First version
** Reduce file size
[2020-07-20 Mon]
+ Initial rejection because of PDF being too large (>10 MB)
*** Make lores versions of some figures
+ ~figs/cousins-of-the-turtle-lores.pdf~
  + spectacular reduction using "Reduce file size" quartz filter in Preview export
+ ~figs/{oiii,nii}-propermotions.jpg~
  + reduce quality in export jpg settings in Preview
+ ~figs/*-map.pdf~
  + export as jpg at 150 dpi and lowest quality
*** Check file sizes of included figures
