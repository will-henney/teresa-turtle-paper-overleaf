> Comments to the Author

> The paper presents a thorough analysis of the kinematics of one of the more enigmatic planetary nebulae, NGC 6210. This PN is notable for its complex geometry, and unusual for a PN, lacks clear symmetry. The authors have obtained an extensive set of long-slit echelle spectra of several emissions lines, and used these to piece together the 3-d structure of the nebula. It is an impressive piece of work. Clearly, there are shortcomings. The slit spectra do not cover the full nebula but leave gaps, and become patchy in the outer regions. however, in the absence of integral field units at comparable resolution it will be difficult to do much better!

> I have very few comments on the paper.  The discussion makes some simplifying assumptions but they are justifiable and the assumptions are pointed out in the paper. I only request some minor additions or clarifications.

> Minor comments on presentation

> The spectra are shown in Fig. 3 as greyscale.  They have limited contrast and lack  information on the intensity scale, and so it is not possible to estimate line profiles from these.  The authors may want to show representative line profiles, or use a colour representation with a  colour-intensity scale.

**TODO**

> The labeling of slits is comprehensive. But I found myself confused when some of the labels were also used for structural axes, e.g. in Fig. 12 'A' and 'B' refers to axes, but in Fig. 7 which it refers to, these designate slit positions. It is not a show stopper but  could perhaps be .

**TODO**

> Axis directions in figures are indicated in E vs W, but none of the figures explicitly state the orientation. It may be helpful to add which direction is east in Fig. 1. (It can of course be deduced from any of the figures which shows coordinates).

We have added a compass to Fig 1, indicating N and E.

> Other comments

> In section 3, the  pattern of the proper motions, with edge curvature and a minimum above the centre  of the nebula has some similarity to the pattern of image distortion in WFPC2 (https://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfpc2/Wfpc2_hand_current/ch5_psf12.html, Fig. 5.17). The current paper does not describe the images, whether the pointing and image rotation was identical, nor how the image distortion was corrected. This should be clarified. I believe that the WFPC2 drizzle images downloaded from the STScI archive are not corrected for distortions but I may be wrong. Note the presence of non-radial vectors, while later in the paper velocities are assumed to be radial.

**TODO**

> How are the velocities of the components calculated? Are they the velocity of peak intensity, mid-velocity, etc? An example spectrum with a derived velocity may be useful.

**TODO**

> In Fig. 12, the spatial extent of the emission along the major axis (A) and the minor axis (B) is very nearly the same (14 vs 12 arcsec), whereas in the image of Fig 11 they look more distinct. That raises the question whether all the velocities identified as such belong to the inner-most shell. 

**TODO**

> This paper frequently mentions velocity gradients in the analysis, but the numbers are given as velocity amplitude (e.g. +-3 km/s) rather than as a gradient. Either the terminology or the units need updating. 

**TODO**

> Last sentence of section 4.2; I did not understand how diffuse versus compact emission can show a spatial velocity gradient. The statement does not seem to  link well with the previous sentence.

**TODO**

> I find the knot complex the hardest to understand. It has a velocity that differs from the rest of structures, has a clear red-blue asymmetry, and is offset from the centre of the nebula in Fig. 1. It gives the impression of an asymmetric toroidal structure.  The abstract stresses the structure as tracing a 180 degree flip of ejection axis 2000 years ago.   I would be quite interested in further discussion.  It can be difficult to measure acccurate kinematic ages for structures near the line of sight. Is there an alternative interpretation possible which does not require the 180 degree change at one point, something not seen in any other structure in the nebula, even those which overlap in age with the knot complex, nor is it known from other PNe? How about non-radial velocity components, as are apparent in Fig 5? The reconstruction of Fig. 22 puts the knot complex outside of the lobes while the numbers of Table 2 places them closer to the centre than the lobes (if I understand this correctly). It seems unexpected such dense structures are embedded in a very low density halo. In Fig. 20, if I were to plot just the crosses, it would give the suggestion of an expanding shell. I have no opinion on this but would be interested in further discussion in the paper. 

**TODO**

> As the authors point out, the derived ages assume that velocities have remained constant. Photo-ionization and interacting winds both cause significant velocity changes, and in that case the lines of constant age in Fig 20 can also be the onset of acceleration of gas that may have been ejected earlier. This may complicate the derivation of a detailed mass loss history. It seems to me that the most important conclusion of Sect 5.3 would be whether a  very brief ejection event can be ruled out: such a near-instantaneous event is expected from a common envelope system.

**TODO**

> And as a final point: PN lobes have quite a short visibility life. Gesicki et al. (2016) find a few thousand years, similar to the numbers in this paper. That raises the question whether there could be older lobes that have faded beyond visibility. Perhaps the authors wish to comment on this.
